**Steps**
1. Got to https://results.thecaucuses.org/
2. Open the developer tools / inspector window, and go to the console
3. Paste this JS script in, and press enter
4. Paste the contents (CSV) into a spreadsheet



**Reason this was created**

The Iowa DNC's results page does not use traditional HTML tables, so it is not trivial to copy and paste to a spreadsheet.
